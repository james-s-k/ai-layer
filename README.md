# AI Layer — WordPress Plugin

Turn your website into something you can ask questions to — not just click through.

AI Layer transforms your WordPress site from a collection of pages into a structured system that can answer questions, expose clean data, and drive actions. Instead of AI scraping messy content and guessing at relationships, it queries your site directly and gets accurate, structured responses.

---

## In Simple Terms

Websites are built for humans to browse. AI can read them — but it has to interpret unstructured content, guess at relationships, and piece together answers across multiple pages. That's slow, unreliable, and wrong more often than it should be.

AI Layer fixes this by giving your site a parallel data layer: clean, typed, connected, and queryable.

> Humans browse your site. AI queries it.

---

## Why This Exists

Every business website contains the same core information — what you offer, where you operate, what you charge, what customers say about you, how to get in touch. But that information is buried in page copy, scattered across templates, and formatted for a human eye.

AI chatbots, voice assistants, and AI-powered search tools need that same information in a form they can use: structured, authoritative, and consistent. Right now they have to guess. AI Layer removes the guessing.

---

## What It Does

AI Layer creates a single source of truth for your business inside WordPress.

You enter your services, locations, FAQs, trust signals, and calls-to-action once — with proper structure, relationships, and metadata. Everything connects: a service knows its related FAQs, which locations it applies to, what proof supports it, and what someone should do next.

That structured data is exposed through simple REST endpoints. Any AI system, agent, or integration can query it directly and get back exactly what it needs — no scraping, no parsing, no guesswork.

AI Layer does not modify your front-end. It operates as a pure data and API layer, working alongside your existing theme, content, and SEO setup.

---

## The Answer Engine

The standout feature is the built-in answer engine.

Send it a natural language question — `"Do you offer SEO in London?"`, `"How much does web design cost?"`, `"What happens after I place an order?"` — and it detects what the question is about, finds the most relevant data in your site, and returns a structured response with an answer, supporting proof, and next actions. All from your content. No external AI call required.

The engine works through a rules-based pipeline: it checks for manually-authored answers first (so you can guarantee specific responses to predictable questions), then falls back to scoring your FAQs, services, and locations to assemble the best possible answer. Every response includes a confidence level and a source field so the consuming application can decide how to present it.

This is what turns your site from something that can be browsed into something that can be queried.

---

## Example

**Without AI Layer** — an AI has to read multiple pages and guess:

> "Let me check the services page... and the contact page... and the pricing page..."

**With AI Layer** — one request, one structured response:

```
GET /wp-json/ai-layer/v1/answers?query=Do+you+offer+SEO+in+London
```

```json
{
  "data": {
    "answer_short": "Yes, we offer SEO Consultancy in London and surrounding areas.",
    "confidence": "high",
    "service": { "name": "SEO Consultancy", "from_price": 500, "currency": "GBP" },
    "location": { "name": "London", "region": "Greater London" },
    "actions": [{ "type": "book", "label": "Book a free call", "url": "https://..." }],
    "supporting_data": [{ "type": "testimonial", "headline": "Doubled our traffic in 6 months" }]
  }
}
```

Same question. One hop. Structured answer with context and a next step attached.

## Common questions & assumptions

You will hear AI Layer compared to things you already know — REST, GraphQL, schema markup, MCP. That usually means you are in the right conversation. Below is a straight comparison so you can decide whether this plugin fits what you are building.

**The short version:** AI Layer does not replace WordPress’s REST API, Schema.org JSON-LD, or MCP. It adds a **business layer** between your raw site data and anything that needs **meaning**: what you offer, how it fits together, and what someone should do next — without inferring that from pages and templates.

### “Isn’t this just the REST API?”

WordPress already gives you REST endpoints for posts, users, blocks, and more. Those are general-purpose **data access**. AI Layer adds **purpose-built surfaces**: a single business profile, typed entities (services, locations, FAQs, proof, actions), explicit relationships between them, and (with Pro) a **natural-language answer** built from that model — not whatever JSON happened to land in a page.

So: ordinary REST answers “what records exist?” AI Layer helps answer “what should an agent **do** with this business, in one structured step, when someone asks a question.”

### “This is like GraphQL / a headless CMS”

GraphQL and headless stacks excel at **flexible queries** — you ask for the shape you need as a developer. AI Layer focuses on **predictable shapes for AI** — responses tuned for questions, next steps, and trust signals from **your** business model. You can use both; they address different layers of the stack.

### “Schema.org already does this”

Schema markup is mainly **page-level metadata for search** — great for rich results, not a full operational model of your business. It does not replace a graph of services, locations, FAQs, and actions, and it does not drive dynamic, query-shaped responses. When you enable JSON-LD Schema markup in AI Layer, it works **alongside** this plugin’s model; it does not duplicate it.

### “MCP already solves this”

MCP describes **how** an agent talks to tools. It does not define **what** your business objects are or how they relate. You can think of AI Layer as the **data and behaviour model** behind those tools; MCP (or similar) is how clients reach it — the two fit together.

### “Why not just extend the default REST API?”

Transport is not the hard part — **intent** is. Patching generic REST without a domain model still leaves every integration to reverse-engineer your content. AI Layer centralises **what matters**, how it is structured, and how responses are assembled (including the Pro answer engine), so consumers get a consistent story.

### “This feels over-engineered — can’t agents just crawl the site?”

Crawling works until layout changes, JavaScript gets in the way, or answers depend on information scattered across pages — and ambiguity makes bad answers more likely. AI Layer offers **stable, explicit inputs** instead of best-effort scraping; that is the same reason you prefer a database over parsing HTML when reliability counts.

### “Isn’t this a lot to maintain?”

Fair question. The plugin is designed around data you would manage for a serious site anyway (profile, offerings, FAQs, proof, next steps), with relationships wired in WordPress. The more AI Layer saves you from one-off integrations and brittle crawlers, the more that upfront structure pays off. If all you need is slightly tidier JSON with no real model behind it, plain REST may be enough — AI Layer is aimed at cases where **accuracy and structure** matter.

### “What is it actually for?”

Typical fits: AI chat or voice that must answer from **your** services and policies; assistants that need live offerings and locations; workflows where you want **grounded** answers and suggested actions; anything where guessing from page copy is not good enough.

### Do these concerns mean you should skip AI Layer?

**No single objection here should disqualify the plugin by itself** — but they point at what to validate for **your** project:

- **Worth weighing:** how much structure you are willing to maintain, and whether agent or integration outputs need to be **noticeably better** than reading the site (for complex or accuracy-sensitive cases, they usually do).
- **Often misunderstandings, not blockers:** comparisons to schema-only or “just use REST” usually clear up once you separate **transport** from **business shape**.
- **The practical question** is simply: does a structured business layer plus our endpoints solve a problem **you** have?

---

## Requirements

- WordPress 6.0+
- PHP 8.1+

---

## Free vs. Pro

AI Layer is a free plugin with a Pro upgrade available via Freemius.

**Free** includes the full structured data layer:

- Business Profile
- All six entity types: Services, Locations, FAQs, Proof & Trust, Actions, Answers CPT
- REST API: `/profile`, `/services`, `/locations`, `/faqs`, `/proof`, `/actions`
- Schema.org JSON-LD output (Organization, LocalBusiness, FAQPage)
- llms.txt support

**Pro** adds the intelligence layer:

- `/answers` REST endpoint — the rules-based answer engine
- Answers CPT admin UI — author guaranteed responses to predictable queries
- Confidence scoring, source attribution, and proof attachment on every response
- 14-day free trial, no commitment required

Free users who call `/answers` receive an HTTP 402 with an upgrade URL rather than a generic 403, so API consumers get a meaningful, actionable response:

```json
{
  "code": "upgrade_required",
  "message": "The /answers endpoint requires AI Layer Pro.",
  "data": { "status": 402, "upgrade_url": "https://..." }
}
```

---

## Installation

1. Upload the `ai-layer` folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`
2. Activate via **Plugins → Installed Plugins**
3. Fill in your **Business Profile** at **AI Layer → Business Profile**
4. Add Services, Locations, FAQs, Proof & Trust signals, and Actions via the admin menu
5. Optionally enable schema.org JSON-LD output at **AI Layer → Settings**
6. Optionally enable llms.txt at **AI Layer → llms.txt**

---

## Admin Interface

The plugin adds a top-level **AI Layer** menu in the WordPress admin at position 25.

### Business Profile

**AI Layer → Business Profile**

A single settings page that stores your canonical business information. Organised into sections:

| Section | Fields |
|---------|--------|
| Identity | Business name, legal name, type, subtype, short summary, long summary, brand tone (internal), founded year |
| Contact | Phone, email, website |
| Address | Address lines, county, postcode, country |
| Operations | Opening hours, service modes (in-person / remote / on-site) |
| Social | Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, X, YouTube URLs |
| Trust | Trust summary text |

Data is stored as a single JSON object in `wp_options` under the key `wpail_business_profile`.

---

### Settings

**AI Layer → Settings**

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Enable schema.org output | Toggle JSON-LD output in `<head>` |
| Schema type | Organization, LocalBusiness, ProfessionalService, HomeAndConstructionBusiness, LegalService, HealthAndBeautyBusiness |
| Enable FAQPage schema | Output FAQPage JSON-LD from published FAQs |

The settings page detects Yoast SEO and Rank Math and warns you if their schema output will conflict.

Settings stored in `wp_options` under `wpail_settings`.

---

### llms.txt

**AI Layer → llms.txt**

Optionally expose a standardised `llms.txt` file at your site root (`https://example.com/llms.txt`). The file guides AI systems and agents toward your structured data endpoints.

This feature is fully free. It is implemented as a dynamic WordPress rewrite route — no filesystem writes required.

**Settings:**

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Enable llms.txt | Toggle dynamic serving on/off |
| Custom introduction | Optional paragraph inserted after the auto-generated header |
| Include AI Layer endpoints | Include the full REST endpoints section |
| Include /answers endpoint | Shown only when Pro is active; includes the `/answers` endpoint |
| Include key pages | Include a Key Pages section |
| Page URLs | One entry per line in markdown link format: `[Page Title](https://example.com/page)` |

**Generated file format** (llms.txt specification):

```
# Business Name

> Short business summary

## AI Layer Structured Endpoints

Structured, machine-readable business data is available at the following endpoints:

- [Business Profile](https://example.com/wp-json/ai-layer/v1/profile): Business name, contact details, and description.
- [Services](https://example.com/wp-json/ai-layer/v1/services): Services and products offered.
- [Locations](https://example.com/wp-json/ai-layer/v1/locations): Locations and service areas.
- [FAQs](https://example.com/wp-json/ai-layer/v1/faqs): Frequently asked questions and answers.
- [Proof & Trust](https://example.com/wp-json/ai-layer/v1/proof): Testimonials, case studies, and accreditations.
- [Actions](https://example.com/wp-json/ai-layer/v1/actions): Recommended next steps and calls to action.

## Notes

This site exposes structured business data via AI Layer for machine-readable access by AI systems, agents, and search tools.
```

The business name and summary are pulled from your Business Profile. The `/answers` endpoint is only included when Pro is active.

**Conflict detection:**

The settings page automatically detects and warns about four conditions:

| Condition | Severity | Effect |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| Physical `llms.txt` file at site root | Error | Web server serves that file directly; AI Layer route is bypassed |
| Plain permalink structure | Error | WordPress rewrites cannot intercept the request |
| Yoast SEO active | Warning | Verify only one source manages llms.txt |
| Rank Math SEO active | Warning | Verify only one source manages llms.txt |

If a physical file conflict is detected, the settings page remains fully functional as a preview and copy tool — you can copy the generated content and paste it into the existing file manually.

**Caching:** Generated output is cached in a WordPress transient for one hour. The cache is flushed automatically on every settings save.

**Settings stored in `wp_options` under `wpail_llmstxt`.**

## Schema.org Output

When enabled in Settings, the plugin outputs JSON-LD structured data in `<head>` on the front-end.

- **Organization / LocalBusiness schema** — output on the front page, populated from the Business Profile. Schema type is configurable.
- **FAQPage schema** — output site-wide or page-specific, populated from all published public FAQs.

The settings page detects Yoast SEO and Rank Math and shows a warning — schema output is not automatically suppressed, so review your pages to avoid duplication.

---

## Data Architecture

### Storage

| Entity | WordPress storage | Key |
|--------|------------------|-----|
| Business Profile | `wp_options` | `wpail_business_profile` |
| All CPT metadata | `wp_postmeta` | `_wpail_data` (JSON) |
| Plugin settings | `wp_options` | `wpail_settings` |
| llms.txt settings | `wp_options` | `wpail_llmstxt` |

All CPT metadata is stored as a single JSON blob per post. Schema versioning is embedded in each blob for future migrations.

### Patterns

- **Model–Repository–Transformer** — `WP_Post` → Transformer → immutable readonly Model → Repository provides query access
- **Centralised field definitions** — `FieldDefinitions` is the single source of truth for field types, labels, defaults, validation rules, and visibility across admin forms, REST, and sanitization
- **Visibility control** — Fields are tagged `public`, `private` (admin-only), or `ai_only` (reserved). Private fields are automatically excluded from REST responses
- **Relationship resolution** — Post IDs are stored as arrays and resolved to lightweight summaries on demand, preventing bloated responses
- **Sanitization by type** — All POST data is validated and sanitized against field definitions before storage

### Constants

```php
WPAIL_VERSION          // '1.0.0'
WPAIL_REST_NS          // 'ai-layer/v1'
WPAIL_META_KEY         // '_wpail_data'
WPAIL_OPT_BUSINESS     // 'wpail_business_profile'
WPAIL_OPT_SETTINGS     // 'wpail_settings'
```

### Namespace

All PHP classes use the `WPAIL\` namespace, with subnamespaces mirroring the `includes/` directory structure:

```
WPAIL\Core\
WPAIL\Admin\
WPAIL\Admin\MetaBoxes\
WPAIL\Models\
WPAIL\Transformers\
WPAIL\Repositories\
WPAIL\Rest\
WPAIL\Schema\
WPAIL\Integrations\
WPAIL\LLMsTxt\
WPAIL\Licensing\
